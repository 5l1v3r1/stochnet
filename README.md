# stochnet

Stochnet, short for "stochastic network", is a neural network designed to be stochastic rather than continuous. It is a personal experiment to see how much gradient information needs to be passed between layers in a neural net&mdash;and how stochastic this information can be.

# Results

Currently, I have managed to train a network on the basic XOR problem. This was harder to achieve than one might expect. My next step will be to try recognition on MNIST. I do not anticipate amazing results, but we shall see.
